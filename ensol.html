							<p>Working on this game was my first time implementing enemy AI and while it definitely had a learning curve, I ended up really enjoying it and am super 
								interested in doing AI work on future projects. The learning curve mostly came from learning how to implement behavior trees which I decided to use for
								the AI because the code reusability it allowed for seemed seemed like it would be helpful for creating all the enemies. The main thing that I learned from bringing 
								the enemies to life was that coding an enemy's attacks is the easy part, but getting them to move around their environment naturally is a challenge. 
								To implement the movement I ended up using context steering because it seemed effective for creating realistic behavior in our game's large rooms with occasionaly 
								obstacles and also allowed for heavy amounts of tweaking/customization based on how I wanted the enemy to react to certain things around it.
							</p>
							<h2>Enemies</h2>
							<h3>Deer</h3>
							<p> The deer was the first enemy I programmed for the game and was definitely the one I spent the most time tweaking. The attacks were fairly easy to implement, but 
								getting the movement/walking animations/head movements to look good was my biggest challenge with them. One thing that really helped
								getting them to navigate more naturally was adding smoothing between updates of the obstacle detection which prevented flip flopping between the direction they wanted 
								to move. </p>

							<h3>Bear</h3>
							<p> The bear serves as a mini boss of sorts for the game and like the deer has two attacks: a big swipe and a throw attack. The throw attack ended up being the most 
								complex attack to program in the whole game due to the several scripts managing the projectiles, all the math behind calculating the launch velocity/angle, and
								getting the bear to have predictive aiming. I also experienced some edge case issues with context steering when working on the bear's movement and I solved most of them by implementing what I have seen 
								called a breadcrumb mechanic. As the player walks, they leave behind a trail of waypoints that the enemies can target instead of the player when the player
								is behind obstacles.
							</p>
							<h3>Rabbit</h3>
							<p>The rabbit is unique in that its behavior is set up as being in one of two modes: agro, where it charges the player or evade, where it dodges the player.
