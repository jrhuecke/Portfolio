							<p>Working on this game was my first time implementing enemy AI and while it definitely had a learning curve, I ended up really enjoying it and am super 
								interested in doing AI work on future projects. The learning curve mostly came from learning how to implement behavior trees which I decided to use for
								the AI because the code reusability it allowed for seemed seemed like it would be helpful for creating all the enemies. The main thing that I learned from bringing 
								the enemies to life was that coding an enemy's attacks is the easy part, but getting them to move around their environment naturally is a challenge. 
								To implement the movement I ended up using context steering because it seemed effective for creating realistic behavior in our game's large rooms with occasionaly 
								obstacles and also allowed for heavy amounts of tweaking/customization based on how I wanted the enemy to react to certain things around it.
							</p>
							<h2>Enemies</h2>
							<h3>Deer</h3>
							<p> The deer was the first enemy I programmed for the game and was definitely the one I spent
							the most time tweaking. One thing that made a big difference for getting them to navigate naturally was adding smoothing between updates of the obstacle 
							detection which prevented flip flopping between the direction they wanted to move. </p>

							<h3>Bear</h3>
							<p> The bear's throw attack ended up being the most complex attack to program out of all of the enemy attacks due to the need for a projectile manager and
								having predictive aiming. My favorite part about the bear is that the projectile can also damage other enemies which can sometimes
								be funny when fighting the bear with other enemies around.
							</p>
							<h3>Rabbit</h3>
							<p>The rabbit is unique in that its behavior is set up as being in one of two modes: agro, where it charges the player or evade, where it dodges the player.
