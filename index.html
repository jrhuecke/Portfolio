							<h1>Ryan Hueckel</h1>
							<p> <span class="image right"><img src="images/Ryan.png" alt="" /></span>
								I am a game programmer currently finishing up my degree in Computer Science: Game Design at University of 
								California, Santa Cruz. Over my past 3 years of making games, I have collaborated in groups of 3-25 people to develop
								co-op 2D platformers, 3rd person shooters, isometric action-adventure games, and much more. I am always trying to expand my skills 
								by pushing myself to code types of games I haven't worked on before. Based on all the projects so far, my favorite parts of games 
								to program are character controllers, AI, and anything else that makes the 
								game feel more satisfying to play. Outside of game developement, I love playing tennis and am also a big fan of birds.

									<h2>Ensol</h2>
									<p>Ensol is an isometric action-adventure game created in Unity where you uncover the mystery of the forest paradise that will do anything to not let you leave.
										This was my senior capstone which was made in 2 quarters (20 weeks) in a team of 9 students. As well as acting as the programming producer, my main focus for this project 
										was coding the AI for all of the enemies which I implemented using behavior trees and context-based steering. Through working with our lead combat designer
										and character artist, I ended up creating 4 enemies in total, all with their own unique behavior and attacks.
										Read more about our enemy creation process and my other contributions 
										to the project <a href="ensol.html"><b>here.</b></a>

									<h2>Coma Dream</h2>
									<p>Coma Dream is a 3D puzzle-platformer made in Unity based on the dreams one of my teammates had when they were in a medically induced coma. 
										Our team had 7 people on it and we developed in the game in 2 weeks. Throughout the project, I programmed a 3D player controller 
										using a finite state machine, cuboid planet physics, and the behavior for the runaway collectible keys. </p>

									<h2>TacoCat</h2>
									<p>TacoCat is a 2D narrative driven game made up of truck driving and taco making minigames. I worked on this game as a part of the Game Design
									 	and Art Collaboration club which runs a mock studio ever year where students work together to develop a game. In the year I worked on TacoCat, 
										there were around 50 people participating in the club spread out through different departments. My main
										contributions were to the taco making minigame which I did a lot of the customer programming for. </p>

									<h2>Soaring Hearts</h2>
									<p>Soaring Hearts is a 2 player co-op puzzle-platformer made in Unity based on the prompt
									   "Hidden Tutorials". Our team consisted of 9 people and we developed the game in 2 weeks. 
									    For this project I collaborated with a teammate to create the 2D player controller utilizing a finite state machine
									    and implemented all of the player animations/sounds. </p>
