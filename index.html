							<h1>Ryan Hueckel</h1>
							<div class="row">
								
									<p> I am a game programmer currently finishing up my degree in Computer Science: Game Design at University of 
									California, Santa Cruz. Over my past 3 years of making games, I have collaborated in groups of 3-25 people to develop
									co-op 2D platformers, 3rd person shooters, isometric action-adventure games, and much more. I'm always pushing myself 
									to expand my skills and work on new and exciting projects that take me out of my comfort zone. So far, my favorite parts of games 
									to program are character controllers, enemy AI, and user interfaces. 
									Outside of game developement, I love playing tennis and am also a big fan of birds.
									<br> <br> 
									See some of the projects I have worked on below! </p>

									<h2>Ensol</h2>
									<h4>About the Project:</h4>
									<p>Ensol is an isometric action-adventure game where you uncover the mystery of the forest paradise that will do anything to stop you from leaving.
									   I worked in a team of 9 people to develop this game using the Unity game engine and we are releasing the game on Steam later this month!
									</p>
									<h4>My Role:</h4>
									<p>As well as acting as the programming producer, my main focus for this project 
										was coding the AI for all of the enemies which I implemented using behavior trees and context-based steering. Through working with our lead combat designer
										and character artist, I ended up creating 4 enemies in total, all with their own unique behavior and attacks.

										to the project <a href="./ensol.html"><b>here.</b></a> </p>

									<h2>Dracomaton</h2>
									<h4>About the Project:</h4>
									<p>Dracomaton is a fast-paced rogue-like all about swapping between different movesets called "forms" to fight off enemies. The game was created by a team of 14
										people in Unity and it is getting released on Steam later this summer.
									</p>
									<h4>My Role:</h4>
									<p>I joined this project partway through its development as a programmer which required rapid learning of the game's code structure in order to get up to speed on 
										how the game worked. During my time on the project I collaborated with artists and designers to implement content such as items, which interacted with all parts
									    of the game and therefore required lots of communication with the other programmers on the team.   </p>

									<h2>Coma Dream</h2>
									<h4>About the Project:</h4>
									<p>Coma Dream is a 3D puzzle-platformer made in Unity based on the dreams one of my teammates had while in a medically induced coma. 
										Our team had 7 people on it and we developed the game in 2 weeks.</p>
									<h4>My Role:</h4>
									<p>I programmed the player controller using a finite state machine, the cuboid planet physics, and the behavior for the runaway collectible keys.</p>

									<h2>TacoCat</h2>
									<h4>About the Project:</h4>
									<p>TacoCat is a 2D narrative driven game made up of truck driving and taco making minigames. I worked on this game as a part of the Game Design
									 	and Art Collaboration club which runs a mock studio ever year where around 50 students work together to develop a game. </p>
									<h4>My Role:</h4>
									<p>My main contributions were programming tasks for the taco making minigame, mostly pertaining to the customers.</p>
