							<h1>Ryan Hueckel</h1>
							<p>
								I am a game programmer currently finishing up my degree in Computer Science: Game Design at University of 
								California: Santa Cruz. During my time in college I have collaborated in groups of 3-25 people to create games 
								in many different styles/genres such as co-op 2D platformers, 3rd person shooters, and isometric 
								action-adventure games. I am always trying to expand my skills with what I create, but my favorite parts of games to program
								are character controllers, AI, and UI. Anything that makes the game feel more satisfying to play I love to work on. <br>

								 <br> <br> Below is a collection of some of the 
								projects I have worked on!

									<h2>Ensol</h2>
									<p>Ensol is an isometric action-adventure game created in Unity where you uncover the mystery of the forest paradise that will do anything to not let you leave.
										This was my senior capstone that I created in a team of 8 people consisting of 4 programmers, 2 artists, 1 narrative designer, and 1 
										sound designer/composer. We utilized an agile style approach to developing the game and ended up completing the project in 2 quarters (5 months).
									    My main focus for this project was programming the AI for all of the enemies, as well as implementing their animations. I worked with our lead combat designer
										and character modeller to create 3 enemies in total, all with their own unique behaviors. Read more about our enemy creation process and my other contributions 
										to the project <a href="ensol.html"><b>here.</b></a>

									<h2>TacoCat</h2>
									<p>TacoCat is a 2D story game made up of truck driving and taco making minigames. I worked on this game as a part of the Game Design
									 	and Art Collaboration club which runs a mock game studio every school year to create a game with a team of around 25 people. My main
										contribution to the project was doing a lot of the programming for the customers in the taco making sections.</p>

									<h2>Coma Dream</h2>
									<p>Coma Dream is a 3D puzzle-platformer made in Unity based on the dreams one of my teammates had when they were in a medically induced coma. 
										Our team had 7 people on it and we developed in the game in 2 weeks. Over those 2 weeks I programmed a 3D player controller 
										using a finite state machine, cuboid planet physics, and AI for the runaway collectible keys. </p>

									<h2>Soaring Hearts</h2>
									<p>Soaring Hearts is a 2 player co-op puzzle-platformer made in Unity based on the prompt
									   "Hidden Tutorials". Our team consisted of 9 people and we developed the game in 2 weeks. 
									    For this project I worked with a teammate to program a 2D player controller utilizing a finite state machine
									    and implemented all of the player animations/sounds. </p>
